					This is a <strong>strong</strong> word, in which will be
					between the 'strong' tags, as well as to
					<em>emphasize</em> the text, adding the 'em' tag. <br />
					But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
					denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
					give you a complete account of the system, and expound the
					actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
					master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
					or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
					because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
					rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
					painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or
					desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
					because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
					pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
					example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
					exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
					has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy
					a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
					avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the
					other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
					dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the
					charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
					they cannot foresee
